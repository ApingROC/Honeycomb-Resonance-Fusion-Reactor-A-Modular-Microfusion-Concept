# Honeycomb-Resonance-Fusion-Reactor-A-Modular-Microfusion-Concept
This paper proposes a novel, compact fusion energy design based on a hexagonal lattice array of alternating microwave slot tubes and tritium gas chambers. The design leverages electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) for localized plasma excitation, with permanent magnets embedded in flat panel surfaces to shape confinement.
