Honeycomb Resonance Fusion Reactor: A Modular Microfusion Concept

Date: May 13, 2025

Abstract
This paper proposes a novel, compact fusion energy design based on a hexagonal lattice array of alternating microwave slot tubes and tritium gas chambers. The design leverages electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) for localized plasma excitation, with permanent magnets embedded in flat panel surfaces to shape confinement. Fusion energy byproducts, primarily high-energy neutrons, heat water flowing through the microwave tubes, providing a direct thermal conversion method. The system operates in pulsed resonance mode to optimize energy input, control plasma ignition, and extend structural integrity. This geometry-centric, distributed model offers an alternative to traditional tokamak-based designs.

1. Introduction
Traditional fusion approaches, particularly tokamaks and stellarators, are large-scale, capital-intensive, and plagued by confinement and energy return inefficiencies. This paper outlines a conceptual reactor built on a hexagonal modular geometry. The aim is to achieve controlled microfusion in a scalable architecture, using electromagnetic resonance and passive magnetic confinement. This model emphasizes spatial efficiency, structural simplicity, and thermally direct output harvesting.

2. Design Principles
The system is composed of an array of hexagonal tubes. These alternate between two roles: microwave slot tubes and tritium fuel tubes. Microwave tubes feature integrated slots at their hexagonal edges, optimized for ECR coupling. The flat faces of the tubes embed permanent magnets in alternating polarity patterns, creating local magnetic bottle conditions. Tritium tubes are filled with low-pressure tritium gas and are subjected to resonant field excitation via neighboring slot tubes. Fusion events produce high-energy neutrons and alpha particles, which irradiate and heat adjacent microwave tubes. These tubes simultaneously conduct water, allowing immediate heat transfer without traditional neutron blankets.

3. Operational Mode
The reactor operates in a pulsed mode. Microwave energy is injected in controlled bursts to create high-density, short-duration plasma confinement within tritium tubes. This pulsing helps prevent structural fatigue, regulate neutron flux, and optimize power draw. Fusion yield is localized and contained, preventing runaway reactions. The energy transfer mechanism relies on radiative heat from fusion byproducts, which is absorbed by circulating water inside the microwave tubes. This thermal output can then be fed into conventional steam turbine or Stirling engine systems.

4. Advantages and Implications
This model eliminates the need for large magnetic containment structures or cryogenics, drastically reducing cost and complexity. By physically separating energy excitation and reaction zones, the system maximizes directional control and safety. Its modular nature allows for scalable deployment, redundancy, and targeted maintenance. This approach treats fusion as a geometry problem, not an infrastructure challenge.

5. Conclusion
The Honeycomb Resonance Fusion Reactor presents a practical, geometry-driven path to compact fusion energy. Its structure and function are co-designed for efficiency, scalability, and simplicity. This concept is a response to the stagnation of megastructural fusion approaches, offering a new paradigm centered on structure-informed ignition and smart thermal conversion.
