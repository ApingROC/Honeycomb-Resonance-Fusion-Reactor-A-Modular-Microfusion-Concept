Abstract

This paper proposes a novel, compact fusion energy design based on a hexagonal lattice array of alternating tritium gas chambers and microwave-excited waveguide tubes. The design leverages electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) for localized plasma ignition, with slot antennas positioned on the flat faces of the hexagonal microwave tubes. Permanent magnets embedded adjacent to these slots create localized field gradients for enhanced excitation and confinement. The system operates in a pulsed mode to manage energy deposition, structural load, and plasma behavior. A thermal extraction system is integrated into the waveguide structure, enabling direct energy recovery. This geometry-driven design offers a modular alternative to traditional large-scale confinement reactors.

1. Introduction

Conventional fusion systems, particularly tokamaks and stellarators, rely on massive infrastructure, intense magnetic confinement, and cryogenics—resulting in complex, cost-prohibitive architectures. This concept introduces a compact alternative: a modular reactor system based on geometric simplicity and pulsed operation, emphasizing structural efficiency, distributed function, and direct energy harvesting. The core idea reframes fusion as an issue of spatial design and electromagnetic rhythm, rather than brute-force confinement.

2. Design Principles

The reactor core is composed of a repeating hexagonal tube array. The elements alternate between two distinct roles:
	•	Microwave Slot Tubes
	•	Feature slot antennas on their flat interior faces, oriented toward adjacent fuel chambers
	•	Contain internal water channels for heat capture
	•	House embedded permanent magnets aligned to support ECR excitation zones
	•	Fuel Chambers (Quartz Tubes)
	•	Located centrally within the honeycomb structure
	•	Filled with low-pressure tritium gas
	•	Surrounded by a composite neutron management layer (graphite and beryllium), designed for thermal and radiation buffering
	•	Transparent to microwave energy, allowing non-invasive excitation

The combination of geometric symmetry, localized magnetics, and directional coupling enables focused plasma ignition with minimized peripheral disturbance.

3. Operational Mode

The system runs in pulsed ignition cycles, where microwave bursts induce short-lived plasma reactions within the fuel chambers. This intermittent approach reduces material fatigue, simplifies power modulation, and allows passive decay between cycles. By precisely managing plasma lifetimes, the system avoids uncontrolled wall contact while allowing for measurable energy yield.

In addition to uniform pulsing, the system supports sequential slot activation (“chase-the-tail” mode). In this configuration, microwave energy is cycled around the hexagonal structure in a rotating sequence, producing a traveling wave of localized ignition zones. This distributes thermal load, sustains plasma activity, and reduces impedance-related reflection losses. Alternatively, symmetric dual or triple slot firing (akin to a six-piston engine) can be used for balanced excitation and synchronized field coupling. These dynamic firing patterns provide an additional control layer, allowing for adaptive response to plasma behavior without the need for real-time frequency tuning.

A simplified thermal capture mechanism routes usable heat for downstream conversion, with no requirement for elaborate intermediate systems.

4. Advantages and Implications
	•	No large magnetic coils or cryogenics required
	•	Slot placement on flat faces enhances coupling and simplifies construction
	•	Modular design allows for scalability, replication, and local fault isolation
	•	Pulsed mode operation supports both experimentation and practical endurance
	•	Sequential and symmetric slot firing allow field shaping, thermal distribution, and timing control
	•	Entire architecture is compatible with conventional manufacturing, enabling a feasible prototype within a modest budget

This design also supports exploratory testing in waveguide-plasma dynamics, neutron moderation strategies, and alternative field geometries.

5. Conclusion

The Honeycomb Resonance Fusion Reactor represents a clean departure from the scale-locked, complexity-driven models of conventional fusion. It prioritizes a structural and geometric approach to ignition and energy collection—making fusion research accessible, modular, and experimentally rich. Whether as a prototype for practical fusion development or as a testbed for plasma interaction studies, it opens a new path forward with grounded elegance.
